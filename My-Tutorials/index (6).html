						Tired of the sweltering heat of Chennai? Let the Marina Beach be a sweet escape spot for you. Beaches in Chennai along the Bay of Bengal coast, it happens to be the longest beach in India and one of the longest in the world. Got enough time to pay a visit to this amazing place during the morning or evening? We suggest that you should not miss out on experiencing the enthralling view of the sun setting or rising from the beach. You may shop for trinkets such as imitation jewellery, shell mementos from the stalls on the beach side. Among the best places to visit in Chennai with friends, it is perfect to build sand castles or play games like beach volleyball.<br>

						<h2 id="valluvar kottam">valluvar kottam</h2>
						Those of you who love literature must have heard or read about the famous Tamil poet and saint, Thiruvalluvar. For the uninformed, Thiruvalluvar is hailed as one of the greatest Tamil scholars. Valluvar Kottam is an intricately designed chariot built in his honour. The magnificence of Valluvar Kottam can be best experienced early in the morning or when the sun is just setting. Wondering how to reach here? It is located at the intersection of Kodambakkam High Road and Village Road; taxis and buses can be taken from around the city.<br>

						<h2 id="1000 lights">1000 lights</h2>
						This multi-domed mosque, which is a revered place of worship for Local Muslims, literally lights up the Royapettah area of Chennai. It is believed that in olden times, about 1000 lights were required to light up the hall of this mosque which is why it has been named as the Thousand Lights Mosque. As it goes without saying, this place looks absolutely spectacular all glowing: hence, is among the most popular places to visit in Chennai at night. With two minarets towering at a height of about 64 feet, this mosque exhibits the excellence of medieval architectural style.<br><hr>
						<h2 id="government Museum">government museum</h2>
						Do you love artefacts? If you do, you will love the Government Museum of Chennai. This place is known for preserving some of the best ancient (10-13th century) and modern South Indian bronzes. Whatâ€™s more is that the Amaravathi Gallery houses marble sculptures depicting the life of Gautam Buddha dating as back to 2nd century. Truly a gem of a place to visit in Chennai for kids and grownups alike!<br>
